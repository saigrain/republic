systematics correction for PLATO, where each star is observed simultaneously by multiple cameras

The plan is to try to extend the systematics-correction methods for planetary transit surveys based on PCA-like approaches (SysRem, PDC/PDC-MAP, etc) to the case where a given star is observed by multiple cameras (with independent systematics) simultaneously.

We are developing this with the PLATO space mission (https://platomission.com/) in mind though it probably has other more immediate applications.
